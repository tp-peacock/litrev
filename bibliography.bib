  Abstractnote             = {T cell receptors (TCRs) are proteins that recognize peptides from foreign proteins bound to the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell. This interaction enables the T cells to initiate a cell-mediated immune response to terminate cells displaying the foreign peptide on their MHC. Naturally occurring TCRs have high specificity but low affinity toward the peptide-MHC (pepMHC) complex. This prevents the usage of solubilized TCRs for diagnosis and treatment of viral infections or cancers. Efforts to enhance the binding affinity of several TCRs have been reported in recent years, through randomized libraries and in vitro selection. However, there have been no reported efforts to enhance the affinity via structure-based design, which allows more control and understanding of the mechanism of improvement. Here we have applied structure-based design to a human TCR to improve its pepMHC binding. Our design method evolved based on iterative steps of prediction, testing and generating more predictions based on the new data. The final design function, named ZAFFI, has a correlation of 0.77 and average error of 0.35 kcal/mol with the binding free energies of 26 point mutations for this system that we measured by surface plasmon resonance. Applying the filter we developed to remove non-binding predictions, this correlation increases to 0.85 and the average error decreases to 0.3 kcal/mol. Using this algorithm, we predicted and tested several point mutations that improved binding, with one giving over 6-fold binding improvement. Four of the point mutations that improved binding were then combined to give a mutant TCR that binds the pepMHC 99 times more strongly than the wild-type TCR.}

The ability to genetically engineer human lymphocytes and use them to mediate cancer regression in patients, which has recently been demonstrated, has opened possibilities for the extension of ACT immunotherapy to patients with a wide variety of cancer types and is a promising new approach to cancer treatment.}

  Abstractnote             = {Almost all critical functions in cells rely on specific protein–protein interactions. Understanding these is therefore crucial in the investigation of biological systems. Despite all past efforts, we still lack a thorough understanding of the energetics of association of proteins. Here, we introduce a new and simple approach to predict binding affinity based on functional and structural features of the biological system, namely the network of interfacial contacts. We assess its performance against a protein–protein binding affinity benchmark and show that both experimental methods used for affinity measurements and conformational changes have a strong impact on prediction accuracy. Using a subset of complexes with reliable experimental binding affinities and combining our contacts and contact-types-based model with recent observations on the role of the non-interacting surface in protein–protein interactions, we reach a high prediction accuracy for such a diverse dataset outperforming all other tested methods., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07454.001, Proteins help to copy DNA, transport nutrients and perform many other important roles in cells. To perform these tasks, proteins often interact with other proteins and work together. These interactions can be very complex because each protein has a three-dimensional shape that may change when it binds to other proteins. Also, two proteins may form several connections with each other., It is possible to carry out experiments to calculate how likely it is that two proteins will physically interact with each other and how strong their connections will be. However, these measurements are time consuming and costly to do. Some researchers have developed computer models to help predict the interactions between proteins, but these models are often incorrect because they leave out some of the chemical or physical properties that influence the ability of proteins to interact., With the aim of making a better model, Vangone and Bonvin examined 122 different combinations of proteins whose abilities to interact had previously been experimentally measured. Vangone and Bonvin found that the number of connections between each pair of proteins was a strong predictor of how tightly the proteins connect to each other. Particular features of the surface of the proteins—specifically, the region defined as the non-interacting surface—can also influence how strong the interaction is., Vangone and Bonvin used this information to develop a new model that predicts how tightly proteins interact with each other based on the number of connections between the two proteins and the characteristics of the non-interacting surface. The model is simple, and Vangone and Bonvin show that it is more accurate than previous models. Defects in the interactions between proteins can lead to many diseases in humans, so this model may be useful for the development of new drugs to treat these conditions., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07454.002}

Nevertheless, therapeutics able to target HLA-I-associated antigens, with specificity for the spectrum of preferred CTL escape mutants, could prove effective. Here we use phage display to isolate and enhance a T-cell receptor (TCR) originating from a patient CTL line and specific for the immunodominant HLA-A*02-restricted, HIVgag-specific peptide SLYNTVATL (SL9). High affinity (KD <400pM) TCRs were produced that bound with a half-life in excess of three hours, retained specificity, targeted HIV-infected cells and recognized all common escape variants of this epitope. CD8 T-cells transduced with supraphysiologic TCR produced a greater range of soluble factors and more IL2, than those transduced with natural SL9-specific TCR, and effectively controlled wildtype and mutant strains of HIV at effector-to-target ratios that could be achieved by T-cell therapy.}

CD8+ T cells expressing intermediate- and high-affinity 1G4 TCR variants bound NY-ESO-1/HLA-A2 tetramers with high avidity and Ag specificity, but increased affinity was associated with a loss of target cell specificity of the TCR gene-modified cells. T cells expressing the highest affinity TCR (KD value of 26 pM) completely lost Ag specificity. The TCRs with affinities in the midrange, KD 5 and 85 nM, showed specificity only when CD8 was absent or blocked, while the variant TCRs with affinities in the intermediate range—with KD values of 450 nM and 4 μM— demonstrated Ag-specific recognition. Although the biological activity of these two relatively low-affinity TCRs was comparable to wild-type reactivity in CD8+ T cells, introduction of these TCR dramatically increased the reactivity of CD4+ T cells to tumor cell lines.}
